	<h1>Beautiful Tasmania</h1>

	<div id="div_intro">
		<p>If you ever get the chance to visit Tasmania, Australia, Cradle Mountain is a beautiful destination! This photo was taken at sunset in July of 2019. Yes, that is snow on the mountain because July is in the middle of winter in the Southern Hemisphere. The following pictures are from a trip my husband and I look to Tasmania to celbrate our 30th wedding anniversary. We had a fantastic and very memorable trip!</p>

		<p>This little pademelon was near the cabin where we stayed. A pademelon is a marsupial that looks like a small kangaroo. They are very prevalent in Tasmania.</p>
